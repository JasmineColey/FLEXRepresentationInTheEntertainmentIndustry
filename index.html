        <p>When people watch movies, they usually look for relatable characters so they are able to connect with the movie.
          Movies screened in the U.S. are notorious for being less inclusive and sterotypical when it comes to casting women and people of color.
          On the contrary, there have been recent notable films with majority people of color and women portrayed in a more cenamatic and powerful light.
          For instance, Black Panther, Parasite, and even Birds of Prey
          were all able to undeniable turn the heads of people in Hollywood, but is Hollywood still
          too exclusive for comfort?
